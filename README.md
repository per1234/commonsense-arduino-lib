##Installation##
The Arduino IDE has a built-in function for installing libraries.  
Download the library as a zip file and extract it. Rename the resulting 'commonsense-arduino-lib-master' folder to 'CommonSense'.  
Go to **Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library...** and select the folder containing the library.

If you're not using the Arduino Development Environment make sure the files are in a folder named 'CommonSense' and place the folder in your libraries folder.

##Reference Documentation##
Have a look at the [library documentation](http://senseobservationsystems.github.com/commonsense-arduino-lib/) for more information.
The API methods available to developers can be found on the [CommonSense Developers Pages](http://www.sense-os.nl/developers).

##Examples##
Sketch examples are included with this library. You can select one from **File > Examples > CommonSense**.
